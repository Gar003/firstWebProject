            <b>Bhagat Singh</b> was an Indian revolutionary who played a pivotal
            role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial
            rule. He is widely regarded as a martyr and a symbol of the Indian
            freedom movement. Early Life and Activism Born in 1907 in Punjab,
            Bhagat Singh was deeply influenced by the nationalist movement from
            a young age. He was drawn to revolutionary ideas and joined the
            Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), an organization
            dedicated to overthrowing British rule through armed struggle.   Key
            Actions and Beliefs Bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly: In
            1929, Bhagat Singh and his comrades threw bombs inside the Central

            British policies. This act, though symbolic, garnered significant
            attention and sparked a nationwide debate.
